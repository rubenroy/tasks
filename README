A quick and dirty command-line todo-list manager. Aimed primarily at quickness and ease of use.
Philosophy: A single command with minimum number of extraneous characters (besides the actual todo-item itself) should do the trick.
Keep it simple.

Store todo-items locally (for now) and try pushing to gmail/dropbox/some-majorly-universal-online-storage-space. Again, the focus is on less hassle and more of how quickly the user can get the actual work done and move on with her life. 

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a ADD, --add ADD     add todo item
  -l, --list            list all tasks
  -v, --verbose         verbose output
  -f FILE, --file FILE  specify file
